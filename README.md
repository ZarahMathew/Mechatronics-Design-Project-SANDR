The Sahel region, located just on the south of the Sahara Desert is identified as one of the regions with the most solar irradiance in the world. This makes it an exceptionally promising location for solar energy generation. This is particularly important because hardnessing the Sahel's solar potential could provide a transformative impact on both economic development and quality of life in the region. However, the Sahel's proximity to the Sahara desert presents a major challege: frequent sand and dust accumulation on solar panel surfaces that could significantly reduce its efficiency and reliability. Based on our value proposition, this issue is essential for making large-scale solar power in the Sahel practical and sustainable.
