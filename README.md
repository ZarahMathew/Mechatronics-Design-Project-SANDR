# Mechatronics-Design-Project-SANDR
The Sahel region, located just on the south of the Sahara Desert is identified as one of the regions with the most solar irradiance in the world. This makes it an exceptionally promising location for solar energy generation. This is particularly important because hardnessing the Sahel's solar potential could provide a transformative impact on both economic development and quality of life in the region. However, the Sahel's proximity to the Sahara desert presents a major challege: frequent sand and dust accumulation on solar panel surfaces that could significantly reduce its efficiency and reliability. Based on our value proposition, this issue is essential for making large-scale solar power in the Sahel practical and sustainable. 

# Solution
SANDR is a solar panel system that is sustainably designed to block off sand blowing from any direction. It consists of a barrier (which rotates along a rounded rectangular track), and an adjustable solar panel which can til in various angles and directions. From research and testing, we found out that sand accumulation is caused by low winds while high winds blow them off. Thus, during low winds and little rain, the barrier moves to the direction of the wind, the solar panel spins away from it, and prevent sand from lingering or any moisture or rain that can cause the it to grip on the panels. During high winds and heavy rains, the barrier moves away from that direction, the solar panel faces the wind, allowing the wind and the rain to clean away any sand. A more detailed explanation is seen below visually. 

SANDR can satisfy our value proposition by utilizing environmental patterns, and by this we can eliminate as much sand build-up, and maximizing energy generation.
